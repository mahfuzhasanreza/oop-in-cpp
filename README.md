# OOP in C++

## Encapsulation
**Encapsulation** is wrapping up of data & member functions in a single unit called class.

## Constructor
**3 Types in C++**
1. non-parameterized constructor
2. parameterized constructor

**Constructor Overloading:**
Constructor overloading is a concept where we can use multiple constructor in a class. The name of all constructor can be same but their type must diffrent from each other.
